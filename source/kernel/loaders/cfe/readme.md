CFE stands for the Common Firmware Environment. It is (maintained? created?) by
Broadcom. CFE allows running operating systems on the MIPS architecture.

Garbage OS plans on potentially supporting CFE since Multiboot 2 supports MIPS
and we are supporting BIOS (Multiboot2 and EFI make BIOS fully obselete).
