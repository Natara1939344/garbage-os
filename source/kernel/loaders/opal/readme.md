OPAL, or the OpenPower Abstraction Layer is an IBM creation to standardize the
boot environment of their Power architecture. It is supported on POWER8 and later
revisions.

OPAL is supported to open the door to one day having support for other Power-based
machines on Garbage OS (systems such as the Wii U and PS3 are particularly 
interesting in this respect). 

While for around one third of the history of the Apple Macintosh it was based on
the Power ISA, Garbage OS has no plans to support Macs since there is no fine
line between a Mac's firmware and Mac OS. On any Mac other than an Intel-based
Mac (which runs a UEFI firmware) and possibly an M-series Mac (such as an M1 mac),
a port of Garbage OS would necessarily have the look and feel of a modified version
of Mac OS. I feel that, while it would have educational value, it would not apply
to other architectures.
