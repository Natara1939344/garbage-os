# Kernel/loaders/efi

EFI (or the Extensible Firmware Interface) provides a common API for an 
operating system and various drivers to communicate with one another. EFI also
manages the boot process for compatible systems. *Technically* this folder helps
on systems that do not support UEFI booting, however, this folder primarily 
helps Garbage-OS boot on most modern systems.
