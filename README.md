# Garbage OS
Garbage OS is an open-source operating system that:
1. Does not take itself seriously
2. Features a centralized garbage-collection routine
3. Attempts to roll-its-own everything
4. Supports as many architectures as possible.

Garbage OS is published under the LGPL version 2.1. You can learn more about the
license and your rights with Garbage OS [here](./LICENSE) or by reading the 
LICENSE file (which that link points to).

**DISCLAIMER**: The information I present as facts below this point in the 
readme generally reflect what I have garnered from reading on the internet and
from personal experimentation. As such, this information may not all be correct
so do not cite this readme as a purely reputable source. If I am correct, 
corroborate with one of the sources I may list or with a more reputable source.

Garbage OS is currently in the alpha state. While previous builds have gotten to
run on emulator, I did not document what I was doing at all and have forgotten 
all that I did in the intervening year. So. The main purpose of this "reboot"
(pun intended) is to begin documenting almost everything about Garbage OS and 
its development (as you can see in the frequent README.md files). Here is a list
(possibly comprehensive) of all README.md's in the repository:

## Roadmap
Garbage OS does not have a strong roadmap since revelopment just (re)started. I
am a busy college student. While that means I greatly appreciate the educational
value that GOS provides, I also have to worry about classes whose grades 
determine whether or not I graduate. I leave this roadmap here for both myself
and the kind developers who wish to help Garbage OS on its journey.

There is a file dedicated to the roadmap, [TODO_LIST](./TODO_LIST.md)
