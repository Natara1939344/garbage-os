# Garbage OS
Garbage OS is an open-source operating system that:
1. Does not take itself seriously
2. Intends to educate on the functionality of operating systems by providing a 
readable and functioning example of one.
3. Provides (or will provide) the ability to create a High Performance Computing
 Cluster (HPC Cluster) at the Operating System level.

Garbage OS is published under the LGPL version 2.1. Garbage OS is open source: 
you are free to view, build, modify, and make projects from Garbage OS.
Additionally, LGPL allows closed-source projects to rely on Garbage OS, in
addition to open source projects.

# Terms of Use
As expressly stated in the copyright, Garbage OS comes as-is and with no warranty.
Additionally, Garbage OS ships with the terms that all responsibility (good and 
bad) that comes from whatever Garbage OS does (or commands the computer to do)
is shared with (1) whomever installed Garbage OS on the system, (2) whomever
owns the computer, (3) the person who is using the computer or made the decision
to leave the computer unattended. Another way of thinking of these terms is that
Garbage OS is "use at your own risk". 

Let's give an example.
Imagine that John Doe installed Garbage OS on Joe Schmoe's computer and Billy 
Bob left the computer unattended to get coffee. If the unattended computer ate
Sally's kitten, John Doe, Joe Schmoe and Billy Bob would all be responsible, 
similarly, if the computer stopped an alien invasion set to destroy humanity, 
John Doe, Joe Schmoe, and Billy Bob would have a genuine claim to saving 
humanity from certain destruction.

- this hypothetical does not change if any of the people in the example are 
entities (eg, companies, governments)
- this hypothetical does not change if any of the people in the example are 
the same person (eg, the computer's owner installs Garbage OS)
- all actions taken by Garbage OS, intended or not, apply to this hypothetical.
