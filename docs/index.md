# Garbage Operating System
Garbage OS is an open source operating system created to document in detail the methods to create a modern operating system that runs on multiple platfoms.
Garbage OS has these planned features:
1. A centralized Garbage Collection service (hence the name) which:
  - collects leaked resources
  - defragments the heap
2. Its own executable filetype
3. Its own disk formatting scheme
4. Support for:
  - EFI
  - BIOS
  - GRUB
  <br>And all the ISAs supported by the above bootloaders / firmwares.
Garbage OS lists its documentation here. It also lists any and all security alerts on this website.[^1]

Garbage OS published under the LGPL v2.1. Garbage OS is open source software and the source code, even for derivative projects, should always be available. But, 
you can develop closed source applications that use Garbage OS, if you do not wish to produce open-source software.

Feel free to contribute to the main repository and view the source code here: [https://github.com/jrbuchanan02/garbage-os]

[^1]: As of the current version of Garbage OS, there is no real operating system. Once there is one, there will be a page dedicated to any and all security
alerts.
