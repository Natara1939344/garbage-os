# src/bootload/arm/old
Old is relative here since it refers to any 32-bit version of the ARM ISA.

This architecture will be a challenge in that ARM does not like the easy 
identification of a variety of feature-sets and generally ARM processors are 
low power (meaning that performance has a more important meaning). This system
will also have to leverage the power-saving features of ARM the most, as those
can lead to a very efficient system.
