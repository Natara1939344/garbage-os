RISCV-X64 refers to all 64-bit verions of RISCV. The challenge of this
architecture is that I know of no PC-style[^1] device which uses RISCV. The only
use case I know of for it is in Graphics Card Microcontrollers. While that is 
a cool thing to run an operating system off of, I don't think I could easily
obtain user input.


[^1]: PC-style meaning that it powers a personal computer, not necessarily the
IBM-PC architecture, however.
