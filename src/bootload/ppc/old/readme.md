Old refers to any 32-bit PPC system.

The challenge with this system will be reverse engineering the Macs which are 
just about the complete list of PPC systems[^1]


[^1]: The remaining PPC-OLD systems are the Nintendo GameCube, Nintendo Wii, 
Nintendo Wii U, Microsoft X-Box 360, and Sony PlayStation 3. I do not currently
plan on including support for these systems. But, if you insist, I do have a 
Wii U and 360 at home to soft-mod and develop GOS on; create an issue on the
GitHub or make a discussion post about it and I may oblige.
