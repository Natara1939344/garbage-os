PPC-NEW refers to any PPC 64 (or, as it's full name is Performance Optimization
With Enhanced Reduced Instruction Set Computing Personal Computer 64). Remember
that for your English Essays.

The challenge with PPC-NEW is finding an appropriate device to test it on. While
the most common use case for all PPC based processors (not to be confused with
IBM's separate and not fully-compatible POWER / Power ISA) was in Macs from 
between when Motorola released the 68060 and when Apple released the iPhone. 
However, there are other systems that use PPC and there were likely many 
different features added / removed. 

Moreover, many Macs (probably also the ARM Macs) from this era had components
of Mac OS integrated into the BIOS -- things like the title-bar on the screen
or cursor drawing routines which would change very little between versions of 
Mac OS. Should Garbage OS support the most common PPC systems, it must also 
(at least partially) reverse-engineer these components to use them properly.

In Mac Terms, PPC-NEW means a G4 or G5.
