# src/bootload/ia64/old
Old refers to the second iteration of Itanium (which is completely incompatible
with the *first* iteration). Garbage OS will choose to *not* run in x86 mode on 
IA-64 and leverage... imaginary? advantages present in IA-64.

The challenge with this architecture will be finding any hardware which at any
point used the appropriate version of Itanium, keeping a consistent ABI between
three versions of architecture, and debugging any assembly code.
