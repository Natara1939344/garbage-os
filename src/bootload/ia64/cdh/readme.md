IA64-CDL (the Coming of the Devil Himself) refers to the initial iteration of 
Intel's Itanium Architecture. There's a reason that we call x64 'AMD64'. Garbage
OS will choose to *not* run in x86 mode on IA-64 and leverage... imaginary? 
advantages present in IA-64.

The challenge with this architecture will be finding any hardware which at any
point used the appropriate version of Itanium, keeping a consistent ABI between
three versions of architecture, and debugging any assembly code.
