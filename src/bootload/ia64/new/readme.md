# src/bootload/ia64/new
New refers to the third and (final?) iteration of Intel's Itanium architecture.
Garbage OS will choose to *not* run in x86 mode on IA-64 and leverage... 
imaginary? advantages present in IA-64.

The challenge with this architecture will be finding any hardware which at any
point used the appropriate version of Itanium, keeping a consistent ABI between
three versions of architecture, and debugging any assembly code.
