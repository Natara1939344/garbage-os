# src/bootload8086/new
New is relative here since it refers to any 32-bit or 64-bit x86 system. New is 
a 32/64 bit operating system that promises all that GOS has to offer.

Like all of GOS, this target is a challenge because we need the ability to 
communicate and handle the largest possible variety of systems. Across all 
devices which GOS may support, there may be not one, but six or seven orders of 
magnitude difference in RAM (an 386-class machine may have a megabyte or two; 
the Apple Mac Pro (2019 or smtg) has up to 1.5 TB).
