# Todo List
This file describes the roadmap for Garbage OS. 

## Externally Visible Features

1. UEFI build
    -  Successfully output valid EFI portable executable files for the following Instruction Set Architectures:
        - [ ] x86-64
        - [ ] x86-32
        - [ ] aarch64
        - [ ] aarch32
        - [ ] RISC-V64ISv39
        - [ ] RISC-V64ISv32
    - Create valid bootable images for the following architectures, verifying the valid EFI files and bootable images
      requirement:
        - [ ] x86-64
        - [ ] x86-32
        - [ ] aarch64
        - [ ] aarch32
        - [ ] RISC-V64ISv39
        - [ ] RISC-V32ISv32

## Internally Visible Features

1. Types
    - [ ] Adopt the pointer types in types/pointers.h++
