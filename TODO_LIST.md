# Todo List
This file describes the roadmap for Garbage OS. 

1. Get a build built [ ]
    - Get the ability to target EFI-systems and know what the EFI types are [ ]
        + Have own implementation of efi.h that allows targeting multiple 
        architectures. [ ]
    - Have the expansibility in this system to eventually target non-EFI 
    systems [ ]
    - Recursive build structure that allows a customizeable amount of the machine
    to work on building Garbage OS [ ]
    - Build System capable of dumping:
        + Preprocessed Source Code [ ]
        + Compiled Source Code [ ]
        + Assembled Object Files [ ]
        + Linked Binaries [ ]
